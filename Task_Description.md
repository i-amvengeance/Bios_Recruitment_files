# Java_Task
This is the description of the process in which I did my Java Task .  
My Java Progam consists of four files named:  
1.Student  
2.GraduateStudent  
3.Main  
4.Main1  
1.**Student**: This class consists of three attributes - name(String) , id(integer) , courses(Array of Strings)  
This class consists of a constructor called Student which takes in name and id as inputs and initializes the values.  
since the attributes are addressed 'private' , Get and Set methods are used to obtain the values in other classes and so , the respective code lines are written.
